        "response": "Sure! Here's a basic example of Nuxt.js in action:\n\nLet's say you want to create a simple blog using Nuxt.js. First, you would create a new Nuxt.js project by running the following command in your terminal:\n```lua\nnpx create-nuxt-app my-blog\n```\nThis will create a new Nuxt.js project called \"my-blog\" with all the necessary files and folders to get started.\n\nNext, you would create a new page for your blog posts. You can do this by creating a new file called `posts.vue` in the `pages` directory of your project. Here's an example of what that file might look like:\n```html\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>My Blog Posts</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li v-for=\"post in posts\" :key=\"post.id\">\n        <router-link :to=\"`/posts/${post.id}`\">{{ post.title }}</router-link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  asyncData() {\n    return {\n      posts: [\n        { id: 1, title: 'My First Blog Post' },\n        { id: 2, title: 'My Second Blog Post' },\n        { id: 3, title: 'My Third Blog Post' },\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\nThis page displays a list of blog posts with links to each individual post. The list of posts is stored in the `posts` array in the `asyncData` method, which is a special method in Nuxt.js that allows you to fetch data asynchronously before the page is rendered.\n\nFinally, you would create a new page for each individual blog post. You can do this by creating a new file called `/_id.vue` in the `pages` directory of your project. Here's an example of what that file might look like:\n```html\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>\n    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  async asyncData({ params }) {\n    const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${params.id}`)\n    const post = await response.json()\n\n    return { post }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\nThis page displays the title and body of a single blog post, which is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API using the `asyncData` method and the `params` object, which contains the `id` of the blog post from the URL.\n\nAnd that's it! With these two pages, you now have a basic blog using Nuxt.js. Of course, there are many other features and capabilities of Nuxt.js that you can explore and use to enhance your blog, but this should give you a good starting point.",

        "response": "`rc-field-form` is a React library that provides a simple and efficient way to handle form validation and submission. The library provides a set of components to build complex forms and integrates well with other libraries such as `antd` and `formik`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `rc-field-form` with `useForm` hook:\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Form, Input, Button } from 'antd';\nimport { useForm } from 'rc-field-form';\n\nconst DemoForm = () => {\n  const [form] = useForm();\n\n  const handleSubmit = (values) => {\n    console.log(values);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Form\n      form={form}\n      onFinish={handleSubmit}\n    >\n      <Form.Item\n        label=\"Username\"\n        name=\"username\"\n        rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Please input your username!' }]}\n      >\n        <Input />\n      </Form.Item>\n\n      <Form.Item\n        label=\"Password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Please input your password!' }]}\n      >\n        <Input.Password />\n      </Form.Item>\n\n      <Form.Item>\n        <Button type=\"primary\" htmlType=\"submit\">\n          Submit\n        </Button>\n      </Form.Item>\n    </Form>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DemoForm;\n```\nIn this example, we import the `useForm` hook from `rc-field-form`. We create a form using the `Form` component from `antd` and pass the `form` object returned by `useForm` as a prop. We also define an `onFinish` function to handle form submission.\n\nInside the form, we define two `Form.Item` components for `username` and `password` inputs. We set validation rules using the `rules` prop. Finally, we define a `Button` component to submit the form.\n\nWhen the user submits the form, the `handleSubmit` function is called with the form values as an object. In this example, we simply log the values to the console.",
